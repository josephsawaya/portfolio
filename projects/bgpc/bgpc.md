Starting in May of 2020 after finishing my second year I started working with BGPC, created with the intent of building a platform to help people create and fund their non-profit projects. The platform is meant to centralize the accounting and contractual aspects of their project and help fund them.

The way it works is that members of the platform can create for-profit projects. The revenue from this project is split between members according to pre-determined share tables. Part of this revenue goes towards the platform's humanitarian fund that will be used to support non-profit projects on the platform.

I'm somewhat involved in the design process but I'm really here for the technical work. For two months at the beginning of my work the entire team experimented and learned various technologies and how to use them with typescript, for example: [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/josephsawaya/typescript-elasticsearch), [Lerna](https://github.com/josephsawaya/typescript-lerna), [MongoJS](https://github.com/josephsawaya/typescript-mongojs).

We also experimented with the Serverless Framework with AWS for our Infrastructure but we ended up going with AWS CDK instead.

For the month of July we spent time setting up the monorepo for the project and deliberating on how we should develop and test our code.

Since the beginning of August I have been developing the back-end using the [aws-serverless-toolkit](https://joeysawaya.com/projects/aws-serverless-toolkit) we created for this project.

We expect to have a working product by the end of September 2020.
