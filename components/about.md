I'm Joseph Sawaya and I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto.

I started writing software in January of 2019 and since then I have been hooked.

I've attended hackathons, joined design teams and worked on some open-source projects.

I'm currently taking part in a 16-month internship at Red Hat.

I have some experience with: 
  - C/C++
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - AWS, Firebase
  - Python, Numpy

Things I'm looking to learn next are 
  - Rust
  - Go
  - Elixir
  - More Cloud Technologies 

I'm always looking for new challenges and more things to learn.
