## About me

My name is Joseph Sawaya and I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto.

I started writing software in January of 2019 and since then I have been hooked.

I've attended hackathons, joined design teams and have recently been working on a platform with BGPC.

My interests include TypeScript, C++, AWS, and I'm currently learning Rust.

I'm always looking for new challenges and more things to learn.
